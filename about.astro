  <h1>About CoreSquares</h1>
  <p>CoreSquares was founded on one belief: solid fundamentals win games. I’m Corey Zapin, and I created this brand to help players focus on what actually works—controlling the center, improving piece activity, and making smart, grounded decisions.</p>
  <p>The name combines my own—<em>Corey</em>—with the four core center squares e4, d4, e5, d5. And the hashtag? It’s a nod to checkmate. CoreSquares is about getting you there, smarter and faster.</p>
