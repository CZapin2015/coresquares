      <h1>About CoreSquares</h1>
      <p>CoreSquares was founded on one belief: solid fundamentals win games. I’m Corey Zapin, and I started this brand to help players cut through flashy nonsense and focus on what actually works—controlling the center, improving piece activity, and making smart, grounded decisions.</p>
      <p>The name comes from my name, *Corey*, and the core center squares of the chessboard—e4, d4, e5, d5. The hashtag? A symbol for checkmate, a nod to the end goal of every game. CoreSquares is about helping you reach that goal smarter and faster.</p>
